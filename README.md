# K-Nearest Neighbors for Diabetes Detection

## 📖 Description

This project uses the KNN algorithm to predict diabetes based on medical attributes.

## 🧠 Model Explanation

KNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification (and sometimes regression). 

It works based on similarity — it looks at the K closest data points in the training set and uses majority voting to assign a label.

📌 Key Ideas:

It doesn't learn from training data explicitly (it's lazy learning).

It uses a distance metric (like Euclidean distance) to find the closest neighbors.

It is simple and intuitive, but can be slow on large datasets.


## ✅ Benefits

Simple and effective

No training phase required

## ⚠️ Limitations

Slow prediction on large datasets

Sensitive to feature scaling

## 📊 Dataset

Name: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

Source: UCI / Kaggle

Features: Glucose, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, etc.

Target: 0 = No diabetes, 1 = Diabetes
