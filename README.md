# K-Nearest Neighbors for Diabetes Detection

## 📖 Description

This project uses the KNN algorithm to predict diabetes based on medical attributes.

## 🧠 Model Explanation

KNN is a non-parametric method that classifies new points based on the majority label of their k-nearest neighbors in the training data.

## ✅ Benefits

Simple and effective

No training phase required

## ⚠️ Limitations

Slow prediction on large datasets

Sensitive to feature scaling

## 📊 Dataset

Name: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

Source: UCI / Kaggle

Features: Glucose, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, etc.

Target: 0 = No diabetes, 1 = Diabetes
